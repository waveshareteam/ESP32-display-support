## üåü Features

- **Adding DIY solutions:**
    - We are very interested in DIY solutions, and we will continue to add DIY features to each product page, such as adding a vibration motor and the use of GPS
- **More driver library support:**
    - In general, the underlying drivers for sensors (including screens) are the same, and we support different popular driver libraries. If you have additional driver library support requirements, please send us an issue or PR
- **MicroPython support**
  - In the development platform, the current unified support ESP-IDF and Arduino IDE, this is the current ESP32 series chip mainstream practice, of course, the chip is also compatible with other development platforms, we hope that more people can use their favorite development environment, so we will try to deal with the possibility of more platform adaptation in the limited time
- **PlatformIO support**
  - It has the same expectations as MicroPython
- **HAos ESPHome support**
  - We hope that we can support ESPHome access to HAOS in the near future, which we are currently investigating. Share with us if you have any suggestions
